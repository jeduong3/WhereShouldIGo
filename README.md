# Where Should I Go Project

For my final project, I developed a web application to help users efficiently select a destination. This application offers a selection of destination options based on user preferences. Users can choose more than one selection from five different activities, and specify their maximum travel distance from their current location. If current location is not preferred by users, then the default location will be Seattle, Downtown. If users are open to traveling any distance, a maximum travel distance selection is not required. Alternatively, they can choose an option to be taken anywhere, disregarding the maximum distance. Upon submission, the application displays a list of destinations that match the user's criteria, to help users in their decision making process.
